## About

These are the custom skills that I use with Amazon Alexa.
Alexa is awesome!

### Reminder for myself on how to create a new skill.

1. Have an amazon developer and avs account.
2. Make sure you set the location to X everytime.
3. Create a Thing on amazon avs IoT platform.
4. Download the connection kit for ~~NodeJS~~
    * ~~Learn node js.~~
    * Python.
5. Save THING_ARN from the interact page.
6. Goto Amazon Lambda, make a lambda function.
    * Use THING_ARN and Alexa Skills Trigger, if Alexa skills trigger is not present, switch location.
7. Save Lambda ARN.
8. Goto Amazon Developer Alexa and create new skill set.
9. Everything should be connected. Magic!
